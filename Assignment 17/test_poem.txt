"The Show Must Go On"

Empty spaces.
What are we living for?
Abandoned places.
I guess we know the score.

On and on.
Does anybody know what we are looking for?

Another hero,
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime.

Hold the line.
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
Inside my heart is breaking.
My make-up may be flaking.
But my smile still stays on.

Whatever happens,
I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache,
Another failed romance.

On and on.
Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning.
I must be warmer now.
I'll soon be turning
'Round the corner now.

Outside the dawn is breaking,
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
Inside my heart is breaking.
My make-up may be flaking,
But my smile still stays on.

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies.
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die.
I can fly, my friends.

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
I'll face it with a grin.
I'm never giving in—
Oh—with the show.

I'll top the bill,
I'll overkill.
I have to find the will to carry on with the show.
On with the show.

Show must go on.
